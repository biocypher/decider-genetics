# DECIDER genetics knowledge graph

This pipeline creates a BioCypher knowledge graph from Hautaniemi lab pipeline
outputs. It requires access to the data files to run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation (local, for docker see below)
```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/biocypher/decider-genetics.git
cd decider-genetics
poetry install
poetry run python create_knowledge_graph.py
```

## üê≥ Docker

This repo also contains a `docker compose` workflow to create the example
database using BioCypher and load it into a dockerised Neo4j instance
automatically. To run it, simply execute `docker compose up -d` in the root 
directory of the project. This will start up a single (detached) docker
container with a Neo4j instance that contains the knowledge graph built by
BioCypher as the DB `neo4j` (the default DB), which you can connect to and
browse at localhost:7474. Authentication is deactivated by default and can be
modified in the `docker_variables.env` file (in which case you need to provide
the .env file to the deploy stage of the `docker-compose.yml`).

Regarding the BioCypher build procedure, the `biocypher_docker_config.yaml` file
is used instead of the `biocypher_config.yaml` (configured in
`scripts/build.sh`). Everything else is the same as in the local setup. The
first container (`build`) installs and runs the BioCypher pipeline, the second
container (`import`) installs Neo4j and runs the import, and the third container
(`deploy`) deploys the Neo4j instance on localhost. The files are shared using a
Docker Volume. This three-stage setup strictly is not necessary for the mounting
of a read-write instance of Neo4j, but is required if the purpose is to provide
a read-only instance (e.g. for a web app) that is updated regularly; for an
example, see the [meta graph
repository](https://github.com/biocypher/meta-graph). The read-only setting is
configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file
(`NEO4J_dbms_databases_default__to__read__only: "false"`) and is deactivated by
default.
